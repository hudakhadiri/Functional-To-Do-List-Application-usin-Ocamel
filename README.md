# Functional-To-Do-List-Application-usin-Ocamel
This project will allow us to implement a simple to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, remove tasks, and view their tasks. The emphasis here is on using pure functions for operations and higher-order functions for handling task manipulations.

Functional To-Do List: Features

    Add a Task: Add tasks to the list (tasks are just strings for simplicity).
    Remove a Task: Remove a specific task from the list.
    Mark Task as Completed: Mark a task as completed (for simplicity, you can store tasks as tuples of (task, completed)).
    List All Tasks: View all tasks, with their completion status.
    Filter Tasks: Show only the completed or pending tasks.
    Save and Load Tasks: Optional feature to persist tasks to a file (using pure functions for handling file operations).

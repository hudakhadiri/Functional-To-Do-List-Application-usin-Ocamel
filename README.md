# Functional-To-Do-List-Application-usin-Ocamel
This project will allow us to implement a simple to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, remove tasks, and view their tasks. The emphasis here is on using pure functions for operations and higher-order functions for handling task manipulations.
